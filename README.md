# Forthcoming articles plugin for OJS 3.1.0.1 

*NOTE: WORK IN PROGRESS*

Forthcoming articles plugin enables a journal to preview single articles publicly before the actual issue has been published.

After enabling the plugin the Schedule for Publication form includes a selection "Show as forthcoming". Choose the future issue you wish to publish the article in and check the "show as forthcoming" checkbox, hit save.

All articles with this selection will be shown in *SITE/JOURNALNAME/forthcoming/*

After the issue is published, the article will be automatically removed from the listing.

Todo:
- Remove forthcoming flag from submission_settings upon publication of the new issue

Problems:
- how to deal with OJS statistics?
- for example pdf galley plugin has problems, because the return link is hard coded and points to the actual article page.
